# Astro-Rumble
Created as a first year final project in college, by Myself, Joshua Thompson and Connor Cozad. This platform jumping game was written using Java and JavaFX libraries. No game engine involved. The game takes place in a forest where you play as a Shawarma character who jumps on platforms to collect coins while avoiding meteors. You can purchase upgrades from a shop and use them in game.
